## How to use
You must have a hacked 3DS and a save file manager installed. Using the save file manager, save the game to your SD Card, then insert your SD Card in the PC. Back up your save file first! Then locate the save file with the save editor and load either ML4_001 or ML4_002 (001 = file 1, 002 = file 2). Edit the save file, save it, put the save file back on the SD Card and load the save file!

## Warning
As I mentioned, **back up your save file!** This save file editor is currently broken and editing your save file WILL break the game in some way! The currently only known major bug is the fact your experience gets set to 0, meaning you will have to gain all your experience back to level up.
A new save file editor may be made some time in the future, possibly rewriting the entire program from scratch.
