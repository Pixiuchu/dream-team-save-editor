## How to use
You must have a hacked 3DS and a save file manager installed. Using the save file manager, save the game to your SD Card, then insert your SD Card in the PC. Back up your save file first! Then locate the save file with the save editor and load either ML4_001 or ML4_002 (001 = file 1, 002 = file 2). Edit the save file, save it, put the save file back on the SD Card and load the save file!

## Warning
As I mentioned, **back up your save file!** Not too much testing was done and so it's entirely possible your save file can get corrupted! (It shouldn't, but just to be safe!). If you find any bugs, please do report it! Thanks!
